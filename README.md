a.	variable can only contain letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers (0 to 9), and the underscore character. You can access the value stored in a variable by prefixing its name with the dollar sign ($). 


b.	This script is created using vi editor based on Unix, you need to execute the file ending with .sh by typing ./the_filen_name, after you execute the file it will ask you for some specific information and it will store it in a other file ending with .csv.

c.	To terminate a program, you need to press CTRL+z and it will terminate the program immediately.


d.	To get the input from the user first you need an output asking the specific information using (echo) after that, by using the (read) the program take the input from the user and store the information. 

e.	Each variable in this program have a specific data type for example I used the String data type for inputting name and it cannot take integer as data type, if you put integer in the name field it asks you to put a valid (string in this case) data type. The same goes to the marks and ID which I used integer as data type and cannot take string as data type.


f.	You can add as much record as you want in the same file just by using the ( >>File_name ).
